# From Self-Taught Musician to Music Academy Founder: Jack's Journey

Jack's story is one of early entrepreneurial spirit and a deep desire to improve music education. Let's explore how he transformed his passion into a thriving music academy, Performance Collective.

## Teenage Beginnings and Self-Taught Guitar

Jack's musical journey began in his teenage years. Unlike his peers focused on traditional career paths, Jack was drawn to the guitar. He started playing at 13 or 14, teaching himself the instrument. Even then, he knew music was his passion, though the exact path wasn't yet clear.

## Early Teaching Experiences

Even as a teenager, Jack possessed an entrepreneurial spirit. He began teaching guitar lessons in students' homes, earning money while furthering his own musical education. He enrolled at the Delhi School of Music, specializing in classical guitar. While contemporary music was his first love, he developed a deep appreciation for classical music.

His initial earnings were modest, around 150 rupees per class back in 1999. However, this early experience laid the foundation for his future endeavors.

## Faculty Position at Delhi School of Music

By 19, Jack's talent and dedication earned him a faculty position at the Delhi School of Music. He also worked freelance at several private schools. For about five years, he juggled these teaching roles, gaining valuable experience in the music education industry.

## The Birth of Performers Collective

During his time teaching, Jack noticed a recurring problem: a lack of innovation and improvement in music education. Frustrated with the status quo, he sought to create a better learning environment for aspiring musicians.

In 2003, he met a young piano player who shared his vision. Together, they decided to start their own music school, Performers Collective. Despite limited business knowledge and capital, they were driven by a desire to do things differently. Jack borrowed a significant sum of money, and with his partner's investment, they rented a small shop in Delhi.

# Building and Scaling Performers Collective: Growth, Challenges, and Partnerships

The early years of Performers Collective were marked by rapid expansion. What started as a small shop quickly grew into a five-classroom building, then a twelve-classroom building, and eventually encompassed three branchesâ€”all within just four years. This explosive growth, while exciting, presented unforeseen challenges.

## Navigating Rapid Growth and a Pivotal Split

The rapid growth was more than the team was prepared for. The business needed more capital and dedicated time. This period of intense growth ultimately led to a divergence in vision between Jack and his co-founder.

In 2008, Jack and his co-founder parted ways due to differing opinions on the future direction of Performers Collective. Jack's partner was drawn to franchising, while Jack felt strongly that it would compromise the quality and integrity of the music education they provided. This difference became irreconcilable, leading to Jack buying out his partner's shares. At the time of the split, the business was valued at approximately 1 crore.

## Integrity in Partnerships and Strategic Evolution

The experience with his co-founder underscored the importance of integrity in partnerships. Trust and a shared vision were essential for navigating the inevitable challenges of entrepreneurship. As the business matured, Jack's strategic thinking also evolved. He realized the need to define Performers Collective's niche and avoid trying to be everything to everyone. This involved making difficult decisions, such as discontinuing group lessons, despite their profitability, to ensure a higher quality of education for each student.

Jack's commitment to quality and integrity shaped Performers Collective's trajectory, leading him to prioritize the student experience and long-term reputation over short-term financial gains, ultimately building a stronger brand and a more successful business.

## Quality vs. Quantity: Defining Success in Music Education

Jack made a conscious decision to prioritize quality over quantity at Performers Collective, even if it meant reducing the number of students. This wasn't just a business strategy; it was a philosophical choice rooted in his passion for music education and a desire to provide the best possible learning experience.

### Shifting to Individualized Instruction

One key measure Jack took to ensure a high standard of education was shifting from group lessons to individual instruction. While group lessons might have been more financially lucrative, he recognized that they often led to uneven progress among students. Some students would excel, while others would get left behind. By focusing on one-to-one lessons, Jack could tailor the instruction to each student's individual needs and learning style, maximizing their potential for success.

### Defining and Measuring Success

For Jack, success isn't just about learning a few songs or impressing friends. It's about developing a deep understanding of music theory, technique, and musicality. He defines success for his students by measuring their progress against established benchmarks, such as the graded system used in the UK. This allows him to track their development and ensure they are reaching their full potential.

### The Importance of Passionate Educators

Finding the right teachers who share a passion for education is also crucial. Jack emphasizes the importance of hiring instructors who are not only skilled musicians but also dedicated educators committed to their students' success. He looks for teachers who have a genuine love for teaching and a deep understanding of music pedagogy. "You got to find the right guy," he says, emphasizing the need for teachers who are competent and passionate about their craft. Jack believes that by hiring the right people, he can create a learning environment where students can thrive and achieve their musical goals.

# Navigating the Digital Landscape: Online Music Education and the Future of Performers Collective

The COVID-19 pandemic forced Performers Collective, like many other educational institutions, to rapidly transition to online music education. This shift presented a unique set of challenges, particularly in competing with larger, well-funded players in the digital space.

## Challenges and Opportunities in the Digital Realm

One of the biggest hurdles Performers Collective faced was the sudden influx of big companies with significant investments in digital teaching. These giants had the resources for extensive marketing and sophisticated platforms, making it difficult for smaller academies to compete.

Despite these challenges, Performers Collective recognized the potential of online education to expand its reach beyond geographical limitations. Jack envisioned leveraging the academy's high-quality instruction to attract students from afar, breaking free from the constraints of being a brick-and-mortar institution.

## Embracing the Hybrid Model

Performers Collective adopted a hybrid model that combined in-person and online learning. Recognizing that many students still preferred the traditional classroom experience, the academy maintained its physical presence while offering online options for those who couldn't attend in person. This hybrid approach provided flexibility and allowed students to continue their music education regardless of their location or circumstances.

All students who attend the physical school now automatically have a link for an online lesson, so they can convert to that at will. The music theory part of teaching was also moved online permanently.

## The Need for Custom-Built Platforms

Jack also highlighted the limitations of current software solutions for online music education. He pointed out that generic platforms often lack the specific features and functionalities required for effective music instruction. This realization underscored the need for custom-built platforms tailored to the unique demands of online music education. Jack believes that custom solutions are needed to truly realize the potential of online learning.
