## The Transformative Power of Education: A Personal Journey

This section explores the profound impact education had on David's life, starting from his early struggles with reading to his academic success and eventual career in education. It highlights the defining moments where he realized the importance of education and how it shaped his perspective on the world.

### Early Struggles and a Reading Revelation

David's journey with education wasn't always smooth. In third grade, he faced significant challenges with **reading**, struggling to keep pace with his peers. He recalls having to spend one of his two recesses in a classroom dedicated to slow readers, practicing aloud into a recording device. This experience was, understandably, "terribly embarrassing."

However, a pivotal moment arrived during the summer between fourth and fifth grade when he discovered the book *Hatchet*. He "absolutely" loved the book and "fell in love with reading." This newfound passion ignited a voracious appetite for books; he devoured over 50 books that summer.

### Academic Transformation and the Seeds of a Career

The impact of this **reading** spree was transformative. Suddenly, school became "so much easier." David went from being "essentially at the bottom of my class to like second in my class." For the first time, he found "joy through success at school," which motivated him to challenge himself further.

This academic turnaround set him on a path that led to attending a private high school, where he even took ancient Greek. He excelled in his studies, eventually attending the University of Chicago and later pursuing a career in education.

### Appreciating the Value of Education Over Time

David's appreciation for education continued to evolve throughout his life. Even while at the University of Chicago, with its extensive core curriculum, he initially questioned the value of studying ancient philosophers like Hobbes and Rousseau. He wondered why he was reading these "ancient ancient philosophers" when there were "real world problems" and he "should be learning hard skills."

However, with time, he came to understand the profound importance of a broad education. He realized that studying these subjects gave him a deeper understanding of human nature, society, and the origins of fundamental ideas. "Now when people talk about justice or people talk about a society now I can actually understand well where did those ideas come from how do we really actually evaluate these things i\'m not looking at things in a vacuum," he explains. This realization reinforced his belief in the value of education as a lifelong pursuit.

## Beyond Vocabulary: The Enduring Value of Classical Languages

Many believe that studying classical languages like Greek and Latin is beneficial primarily for vocabulary building. However, the true value extends far beyond simply learning word roots. The study of these languages offers a deeper understanding of human nature, society, and the world around us.

The enduring relevance of classical languages lies in their ability to connect us with the timeless aspects of the human experience. While technology and culture evolve, fundamental human behaviors and motivations remain surprisingly constant.

Consider the impact of ancient Greek literature. As an example, the comedies of Aristophanes, written over 2,500 years ago, contain jokes about topics like flatulence â€“ humor that still resonates today. This illustrates how certain aspects of human nature have remained remarkably consistent across millennia.

Studying classical languages allows us to read not just *about* people, but to *read* people. By engaging with the writings of individuals from ancient Greece and Rome, we gain insights into their thoughts, motivations, and societal structures. This understanding provides a valuable framework for analyzing and interpreting contemporary issues.

While modern society undeniably possesses greater access to information and a deeper understanding of the physical universe, this increased knowledge doesn't necessarily equate to greater wisdom. In some ways, we may have even lost wisdom and gained arrogance in the process. By studying classical languages, we can tap into the brilliance and wisdom of past civilizations, gaining a broader perspective on the human condition and our place in the world.

## The Character-Building Power of Hard Work and Resilience

This section focuses on the lessons David learned from working at a young age to pay for his education. It emphasizes the importance of hard work, resilience, and overcoming challenges in building character and achieving success, drawing on anecdotes and insights from successful individuals.

### Early Work Ethic: Paying for Education

David shared a pivotal moment in his life when he decided to contribute to his education expenses. In 8th grade, after expressing interest in attending Loyola Academy, a private high school, he learned that despite receiving financial aid, there was still a significant cost. David's parents, with two other children in college, couldn't afford the remaining $4,000 per year. David, at the age of 13, offered to pay $1,000 annually. He secured a job caddying during the summers and took responsibility for purchasing his own clothes beyond the essentials.

### Lessons in Resilience and Character

David emphasized that working from a young age was a necessity for him, and he is grateful for the experience. He referenced Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who spoke to Stanford graduates about the importance of pain and suffering in building character and resilience. Huang argued that entitlement, often associated with attending top schools, can lead to low resilience, which is crucial for success.

David believes that being forced to work at a young age built his character and resilience, giving him an advantage over his peers. He constantly considers how to raise his son to avoid entitlement and to experience failure and pain, learning to overcome challenges.

### The Value of Hard Times

David shared a quote: "Hard times lead to strong men we could also say strong women, strong men lead to easy times easy times lead to weak men". This cycle highlights the character-building power of overcoming adversity. He emphasizes the importance of experiencing challenges to develop resilience and a strong work ethic, qualities that are essential for achieving long-term success.

## SAT vs. ACT: Understanding the Evolution and Key Differences

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests used for college admissions in the United States. Both tests have undergone significant changes over the years, evolving from aptitude tests to achievement tests. Understanding the history and key differences between the SAT and ACT can help students determine which test is a better fit for them.

### Origins and Evolution

The SAT was first introduced in the 1920s as a way to democratize access to higher education at top colleges. At that time, elite institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton had their own entrance exams, which often included questions on Greek and Latin. This gave an advantage to students from wealthy families who could afford to attend exclusive private schools that prepared them for these exams.

The SAT was designed as an aptitude test, aiming to assess a student's reasoning and critical thinking skills, regardless of their background or access to specialized knowledge. The goal was to identify disadvantaged students with high potential who might not have had the opportunity to learn Greek and Latin.

In the 1950s, the ACT was introduced as an achievement test, focusing on what students had learned in school and their ability to demonstrate that knowledge on test day. Over time, the SAT also shifted towards becoming more of an achievement test, although it still retains some of its original aptitude-based elements.

### Key Differences

While both the SAT and ACT assess students' skills in reading, writing, and math, there are some key differences between the two exams:

*   **Focus:** The ACT is more focused on measuring what students have learned in school, while the SAT places a greater emphasis on critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
*   **Question Style:** ACT questions tend to be more straightforward and knowledge-based, while SAT questions often require students to apply their knowledge in new and unfamiliar contexts.
*   **Pacing:** The ACT is a faster-paced test, with less time per question compared to the SAT.
*   **Calculator Use:** The SAT now allows the use of an on-screen calculator (Desmos) on the entire math section, while the ACT permits calculator use on only some math questions.

### Which Test is Right for You?

To determine which test is a better fit, students should take full-length practice tests of both the SAT and ACT. Compare your scores using an official concordance table. Don't base your decision on which test "feels" easier. Since the SAT changed in March 2024 to an adaptive format, if a student scores below 1200, they may not be seeing the hardest questions, which can make the test feel easier but not provide an accurate comparison.

## Debunking Test-Taking Myths and Maximizing Scores

A common misconception is the existence of "good" and "bad" test-takers. While some individuals may struggle more under the pressure of standardized tests, the vast majority can significantly improve their scores through adequate preparation and the right mindset. The key isn't innate ability, but rather a combination of knowledge, skill, and effective test-taking strategies.

### Preparation and Mindset

Many students who believe they are "bad" test-takers simply haven't mastered the necessary knowledge or haven't learned how to manage their mindset and approach the test strategically. Learning to stay calm under pressure is crucial. This involves practicing techniques to keep a cool head during the exam, preventing anxiety from hindering performance.

### Effective Test-Taking Techniques

One critical technique is time management. A common mistake is trying to answer every question correctly. Only a small percentage of test-takers should aim for perfection. The majority should focus on maximizing the number of questions they answer correctly. This means strategically skipping questions that are too time-consuming.

When faced with a difficult question, instead of getting bogged down, make an educated guess, and move on. Spending too much time on a single question can lead to missing multiple questions later in the test. Itâ€™s essential to stick to the strategies practiced during preparation and avoid changing tactics on test day.

### The Importance of Knowledge and Skills

Improving test scores isn't just about tricks and strategies. It also requires mastering the fundamental knowledge and skills tested on the exams. These skills are broadly applicable and contribute to academic success beyond standardized tests. The SAT and ACT assess skills predictive of college success. By focusing on developing these skills, students not only improve their test scores but also enhance their overall academic abilities.
